    activities tab is amazing!
    I was in travel school club and international friendship club in Korea, Konkuk University.<br />
    I was able to practice speaking English by being friends with exchange students in Konkuk and this helped me to learn from different perspetives.<br />
    It eventually led me to go for a student exchange, so that's why I am here!<br /><br />
    In travel club, making travel plans or activities for school festival was main thing I did.<br />
    This helped me to develop planning skills, teamwork and listening to opinions and reflecting them on future activities.<br />
